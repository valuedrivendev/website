A flip-flop can store an input signal &mdash; on or off &mdash; as a state and generate an output matching the stored input. This enables a binary number system by treating the "on" state as 1 and the "off" state as 0. A "bit" is 0 or 1. A flip-flop is suitable for storing one bit. Eight bits make a "byte." When a program asks a computer to change a bit, a byte containing the bit is retrieved, modified and stored on computer memory or a hard drive as a whole. A byte is the smallest unit of information.</p><p>Computer memory or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">random-access memory</a> (RAM) stores many gigabytes of information &mdash; a gigabyte has 1073741824 bits, not one billion bits. RAM is made of a grid of flip-flops connected by electrical paths. Changes to a byte require state transitions in eight flip-flops representing one unit of information. Nobody likes half baked bits, and flip-flop changes must be synchronized. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator">crystal oscillator</a> or "clock" is used to coordinate reading and writing information because a periodic pulse acts as a traffic light. When a clock generates a pulse, the traffic light says "go," and you are free to read or modify bytes. When a clock is in-between pulses, the traffic light says "stop and wait." We wait for pending operations to finish.</p><p>I flip bits when I press a key on my keyboard. I am a conductor for the mighty electrons if you will. I view computer programs in the same light &mdash; they flip bits. I often joke that a computer program is nothing more than a for-loop. A for-loop reads, "for every input specified, generate an appropriate output." Oversimplification? Perhaps.</p><p>The essence of a program is to generate an output given an input. Even a simple assignment is a flip-flop morphing function.</p><pre><code>int a = 1;
</code></pre><p>Just like that, I flipped bits in computer memory to reflect my thoughts. Writing the previous sentence is no different. My beloved <a href="http://www.vim.org"><code>vim</code></a> flips bits in memory, then the computer faithfully stores the bits on a hard drive. I am not the mastermind behind this. Some clever electrical, computer and system engineers; computer scientists and hackers have translated their soul into a big blob of transistors. This crazy world of mine, what would I do without this love?</p><p>I get a sense of control when I type away on a keyboard. Keys make pleasing sound. Letters on the screen fly by. But this well coordinated magic is beyond my skills and understanding. That is okay. They say some mystery keeps a loving relationship healthy. I will let my computers keep the blue smoke inside.</p><p>Can this explain my love for details in my technical work? I aim to understand inner workings of a computer at every level accessible to me. Sadly, I am not smart enough to understand them fully. I leave the true understanding of the machine to people far exceeding my intelligence. I watch from sidelines and take what I can so my undying love makes me warm and fuzzy.</p><hr><h1><a href="#20150721" id="20150721">#</a> Jumbo Patches</h1><div class="pubdate">July 21, 2015.</div><h3>My frustration</h3><p>was at the critical mass when I sent this email to the whole team. Juniors needed a reminder. The technical lead didn't get it. I told the boss about my frustrations. But nothing changed.</p><h3>Please stop writing jumbo patches.</h3><p>Not all jumbo patches are bad. But some are nasty. Nasty jumbo patches are by-products of source code heroics or refactoring and bug fixes. Refactoring is <em>damned</em> hard.

Add bug fixes on top of that.</p><p>How many senior developers would you like to sacrifice to review nasty jumbo patches?</p><h3>All patches should be atomic.</h3><p>That is, a patch should be the smallest coherent change set possible to address one issue. A reviewer should not be asked to distinguish between bug fixes, subtle changes in behaviours and code clean up. Why aren't they separate patches?</p><h3>A small patch is manageable.</h3><p>Reviewers and testers can focus on changes with the most value. A small patch localizes production issues due to a limited scope. A small patch invites reviewers with varying levels of technical skills and expertise. A small patch makes me happy.</p><h3>This is not just my opinion.</h3><p>Open source software has developed practical guidelines that scale to a large group of talented developers.

The project had been on hold for about two months. I figured, "it is about time." To my surprise, diagnosing the problem took some effort despite the detailed documentation. Then I found the bug in a piece of poorly documented code. Go figure.</p><p>What about unit tests? I discuss unit tests at the end of this post.</p><h3>The Bug</h3><p>I wrote a function to replace a prefix of a path with another one.</p><pre><code>;; Re-anchor :name from a to b.
(defn replace-prefix
  [path a b]
  (clojure.string/replace path a b))
</code></pre><p>This was a quick hack for a prototype. Of course, I used the same excuse to skip tests. This function has a few bugs. Can you spot them?</p><p>The function seems simple in isolation, but the bug analysis expands the scope of work. Are there similar problems elsewhere? Should I refactor the code and create a well-tested utility function? It never ends. I told myself, "I wish I had left more context behind."</p><p>I would have found logic errors if I tried to explain this function to myself using examples. For instance, I may have added the following in documentation.</p><pre><code class="clojure">;; For example,
;;  (replace-prefix "/r/a" "/r/" "/R") => "/R/a"
;;  (replace-prefix "/r/a" "/r"  "/R") => "/R/a"
</code></pre><p>Claims made in examples do not reflect the implementation.</p><pre><code>(replace-prefix "/r/a" "/r/" "/R") =&gt; "/Ra"  ; Bad.
(replace-prefix "/r/a" "/r"  "/R") =&gt; "/R/a" ; Good.
</code></pre><p>A possible solution is shown below.</p><pre><code>(defn replace-prefix
  [path old-prefix new-prefix]
  (str new-prefix
       separator
       (clojure.string/replace path old-prefix "")))
</code></pre><p>This function is still incomplete because it does not address many cases.</p><ol><li>What happens when <code>old-prefix</code> is not a prefix of <code>path</code>?</li><li>What about repeated path separators? Does it matter?</li><li>And so on.</li></ol><h3>Examples, examples, examples!</h3><p>I love it when a programmer takes time and care to document illustrative examples in source code. User contributed examples seem very effective as well; see <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map" title="clojure.core/map">clojure.core/map</a> for instance.</p><p>Listing all expected behaviours of a function exhaustively has no value because it leaves creating a concise summary to readers. On the other hand, providing a few representative examples is pragmatic but more difficult than the former. That does mean that we should skip it.</p><h3>What about unit tests?</h3><p>I like well-tested utility functions. They are even better when they come with documentation full of examples. A reliable and automated unit test suite may be a better solution than a list of input and output pairs. But don't you see? You need some possible input and output pairs to write tests!</p><hr><h1><a href="#20150630" id="20150630">#</a> I Love Documentation.</h1><div class="pubdate">June 30, 2015.</div><p>Yes, it is true.

I read <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a> by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> for his writing.</p><p>My love for coding shares the same rationale.</p><h3>Learning requires repetition.</h3><p>Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory">short-term memory</a> is limited.

This is over-simplified but I hope you see the relevance of a small buffer with a long write latency.</p><p>Good documentation is valuable; write it well once.</p><h3>Flaw Discovery</h3><p>Describing a poorly designed system in different perspectives is hard. A high-level overview requires you to assume the role of an architect or a lead.

Why? I found it useful for my work! :-)</p><h3>Where do we specify default values for class constructor parameters?</h3><p>I apologize for indentation and omitting access modifiers. Here is an example in C#.</p><pre><code>class History {
  // A list of old values.
  IList&lt;long&gt; m_values;

  // Initialize with pre-loaded data
  // or no history.
  History(IList&lt;long&gt; v = null) {
    // m_values = v ?? new IList&lt;long&gt;();
    if (v == null) {
      m_values = new IList&lt;long&gt;();
    } else {
      m_values = v;
    }
  }
}

class HistoryFactory {
  Create(IList&lt;long&gt; v = null) {
    return new History(v);
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Constructors should assume that its dependencies are correctly initialized when object creation has been delegated to a framework like a factory or dependency injection. For example, I think this works better.</p><pre><code>class History {
  // A list of old values.
  IList&lt;long&gt; m_values;

  // Initialize with pre-loaded data
  // or no history.
  History(IList&lt;long&gt; v) {
    m_values = v;
  }
}

class HistoryFactory {
  Create(IList&lt;long&gt; v = null) {
    var h = v ?? new IList&lt;long&gt;();
    return new History(h);
  }
}
</code></pre><h3>Default values are configuration data.</h3><p>I think this separates data and code. When default values change, the core logic stays the same.</p><p>While it is common to create new objects in constructors like ours, I delegate that to a factory. This allows me to create an object with a long history for testing while providing a way to reload history from external resources.</p><hr><h1><a href="#20150615" id="20150615">#</a> Simple Stuff</h1><div class="pubdate">June 15, 2015.</div><p>The website source code is available at <a href="http://github.com/valuedrivendev/website">GitHub</a>.

We will talk about that later. If a particular area is troublesome, then you must consider other ways to resolve that. VDD is not suitable for these cases.</p><h3>Think of it this way.</h3><p>This insanity perfectly pleases capitalistic minds. <strong>Source code is a business</strong>. You may argue that it is a business asset -- that is fine. <strong>Every bug is an investment opportunity</strong> because fixing it will increase the business value -- yes, pun intended. The best return from an investment depends on gaining more value than any resource invested; for example, time or salary. It makes sense to minimize the work required to address a problem.</p><h3>Okay, what are you cutting out from this business?</h3><p>Small fixes are easier to verify manually than large refactoring changes thanks to (a) scopes of change; and (b) minimal chances of regression. <strong>Fix bug without writing tests first</strong>. Please test fixes locally to avoid wasting code review and testing time. <strong>Problems found in code reviews or testing indicate the need to write tests.</strong> Then, go write some tests.</p><h3>What if problems persist in the same area?</h3><p>Then, I guess it is time for a heavy-duty refactoring/clean-up axe.</p></div><footer class="footer text-muted"><div class="container"><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="img/cc-license.png"></a> <span xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" property="dct:title">valuedrivendev.com</span> by <a xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" href="http://valuedrivendev.com" property="cc:attributionName" rel="cc:attributionURL">Brian Jung Myeng Lee</a> is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">(link)</a>.</div></footer><script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="highlight/highlight.pack.js"></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script><script>function lazy_load_css(e){var t=function(){var t=document.createElement("link");t.rel="stylesheet",t.href=e;var n=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0];n.parentNode.insertBefore(t,n)},n=requestAnimationFrame||mozRequestAnimationFrame||webkitRequestAnimationFrame||msRequestAnimationFrame;n?n(t):window.addEventListener("load",t)}</script><script>$(document).ready(function(){$(navbar_active).addClass("active")});</script></body></html>
