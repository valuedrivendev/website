The bare and tediously written HTML may surprise you.</p><p>I feel great about it. I am focusing on the content, not the appearance of the website. The appearance will become important. That is for later.</p><p>I believe I am making the right choice. If you agree with me, then I must thank my sources of free advice.</p><p><em>Value</em> does not always mean money. For example, I hope you enjoy reading simple sentences on a small screen. This post is, perhaps, short enough.</p><hr><h1><a href="#20150611" id="20150611">#</a> Mentorship at Work</h1><p>June 11, 2015.</p><p>I have a great manager at work. I am grateful for that. All the co-workers are great too, well, except one. That is for another day.</p><h3>I love being a mentor.</h3><p>You may find this rather odd if you knew me personally. Well, then again, I am a bit preachy. Look at this website! So, yes, mentorship, I truly find it so gratifying.</p><h3>Huh, what now?</h3><p>I love growing influence over people. The fact that I can persuade somebody amuses me. It is even better if everyone repeats back what I say. It starts with little expressions to a common ideal the team shares. So I try my hand at influencing others.</p><p>Of course, that is not all. When I watch people improve their strategies to debug or solve problems over time, it is like watching plants grow.</p><p>The key phrase at work now is, <strong>"Is there any value in doing this work?"</strong> I did pretty well there!</p><h3>I am aggressive at times.</h3><p>That is not for people I mentor. When I am aggressive, I am really saying, <strong>"Wake up, you can do better,"</strong> because I respect and trust you enough to "do the right thing."</p><hr><h1><a href="#20150606" id="20150606">#</a> Refactoring - Decompose Conditional</h1><p>June 06, 2015.</p><p>I recently bought the book, <i>Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code</i>. I enjoy reading it a lot.</p><h3>I am not a fanatic</h3><p>when it comes to these topics anymore. I use what produces the most value. The example below illustrates the idea. Please do not take this literally. Sometimes, refactoring tiny code has no value.</p><h3>An example in Java</h3><p>Before<pre class="highlight"><code class="java">if (min &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= max) {
    y = x / 2;
} else {
    y = x * x;
}</code></pre></p><p>After<pre class="highlight"><code class="java">if (inRange(min, max, x)) {
    y = half(x);
} else {
    y = square(x);
}

private boolean inRange(
    int start,
    int end,
    int x) {
    return (start &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= end);
}

private int half(int n) {
    return n / 2;
}

private int square(int n) {
    return n * n;
}</code></pre></p><h3>I use this the most in Clojure projects.</h3><p>Maybe, that is because I am not so fluent in Clojure yet. The same method seems to be more valuable in Clojure even for tiny functions. Nested s-expressions become very confusing quickly.</p><p>Before<pre class="highlight"><code class="clojure">(let [y (if (and (&lt;= min x) (&lt;= x max))
              (x / 2)
              (x * x))]
...)</code></pre></p><p>After<pre class="highlight"><code class="clojure">(let [y (calculate-y min max x)]
  ...)

(defn calculate-y [min max x]
  (if (in-range? min max x)
    (half x)
    (square x)))

(defn in-range? [start end x]
  (and (&lt;= start x) (&lt;= x end)))

(defn half [x]
  (/ x 2))

(defn square [x]
  (* x x))</code></pre></p><hr><h1><a href="#20150603" id="20150603">#</a> Building Autonomy</h1><p>June 03, 2015.</p><p>If a developer can train two new hires at the same time, then the best case result is having three developers who can train new hires. These three developers are probably enough to sustain the training process.</p><h3><tt>3 x 2 = 6 - 4 = 2</tt></h3><p>When there are three trainers, each trainer can train two new hires. This gives us six newly trained developers. Even if the entire trainer team quits, we can recover by holding onto two or more developers.</p><h3><tt>T1 &lt;- T2 &lt;- ... &lt;- Tn</tt></h3><p>Perhaps, this is too naive. How about this? We introduce a simple linear process. Every hire will always train newer employees. If the mentor does not have an answer to a problem, then we visit the next mentor in the chain. This leaves the most experience developers to handle the most difficult problems.</p><p>Experienced developers are expensive and incredibly productive. They should not be disturbed, and be left to their art where the most value is.</p><hr><h1><a href="#20150528" id="20150528">#</a> Value Driven Development</h1><p>May 28, 2015.</p><p><i>Value Driven Development</i> or VDD emphasizes improving life of <strong>maintaining legacy code without tests</strong>. The suggestions here do not apply to all situations. I would recommend these suggestions for bugs you can fix, and test under an hour.</p><p><strong>Prefer small bug fixes. Avoid writing tests and refactoring until they are absolutely required.</strong></p><h3>Working with legacy code is what we do mostly.</h3><p>When faced with modifying legacy code, most people start with writing tests. That might involve refactoring code first to make it testable. This may take weeks if you are not careful. This is not productive.</p><h3>That is not lost productivity.</h3><p>Right; "the code is more maintainable", "the code is more readable", and etc.</p><p>Well, ugly or not, <strong>legacy code has been around</strong>. In other words, it has been tested in the real world. If it is a one-off bug, then what are chances that you will have to come back to it again? Not all situations work out well. We will talk about that later. If a particular area is troublesome, then you must consider other ways to resolve that. VDD is not suitable for these cases.</p><h3>Think of it this way.</h3><p>This insanity perfectly pleases capitalistic minds. <strong>Source code is a business</strong>. You may argue that it is a business asset -- that is fine. <strong>Every bug is an investment opportunity</strong> because fixing it will increase the business value -- yes, pun intended. The best return from an investment depends on gaining more value than any resource invested; for example, time or salary. It makes sense to minimize the work required to address a problem.</p><h3>Okay, what are you cutting out from this business?</h3><p>Small fixes are easier to verify manually than large refactoring changes thanks to (a) scopes of change; and (b) minimal chances of regression. <strong>Fix bug without writing tests first</strong>. Please test fixes locally to avoid wasting code review and testing time. <strong>Problems found in code reviews or testing indicate the need to write tests.</strong> Then, go write some tests.</p><h3>What if problems persist in the same area?</h3><p>Then, I guess it is time for a heavy-duty refactoring/clean-up axe.</p></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><p class="text-muted"><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="img/cc-license.png"></a><br><span xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" property="dct:title">valuedrivendev.com</span> by <a xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" href="http://valuedrivendev.com" property="cc:attributionName" rel="cc:attributionURL">Brian Jung Myeng Lee</a> is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div></footer><script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="highlight/highlight.pack.js"></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script></body></html>
