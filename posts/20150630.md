June 30, 2015.

Yes, it is true. I love writing it. I love reading it. I enjoy clear and concise
documentation. Why?

### A masterful display of an art

is beautiful. I read [On Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) by [Paul
Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) for his writing.

My love for coding shares the same rationale.

### Learning requires repetition.

Our [short-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory) is
limited. Any information in short-term memory must be committed to
[long-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory) for us to
remember it. This is over-simplified, but I hope you see the relevance of a
small buffer with a long write latency.

Good documentation is valuable; write it well once.

### Flaw Discovery

Describing a poorly designed system in different perspectives is hard. A
high-level overview requires you to assume the role of an architect or a lead.
Describing an example forces you to assume the role of a user.

I find it difficult to explain even a couple of modules clearly when their
design is broken, not to mention varying perspectives.
