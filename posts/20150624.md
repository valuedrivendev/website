# <a href="#20150624" id="20150624">#</a> Reading Code

June 24, 2015.

I am reading _How to Write a Sentence: And How to Read One_ by Stanley Fish. It
is a great read. The consistent theme seems to be "learn the forms." That
reminds me of how I read code.

### My Method

1. Identify the **goal** of a change.

    "Catch the exception, E, and handle it."

2. Identify the **operations** required to implement the change.

    There must be a new <tt>catch</tt> clause.

3. Find **code** that performs the required operations.

    This should be obvious. Otherwise, the patch is too big.

4. Map the **structure** of the change bottom-up.

    1. What happens after the exception is handled? 
    2. Is the relevant code a part of a sequence? If so, how does the change fit
       in the sequence?
    3. Is the exception handled at a correct location?

### "Structure" sounds like "form."

I focus on learning the organization when I review code. It is like jigsaw
puzzle to me.
