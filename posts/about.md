### I code for amusement.

My name is [Brian Lee](http://koreanbrian.com). I am a hacker as in "I code for
amusement." I am not a software developer or engineer. Computer Science,
Computer and Software Engineering complement my interests but not the focus. I
am interested in programming as a writing process.

To me, programming is a process of describing a solution to a problem in the
finest detail. It reminds me of many afternoons I spent as a part of a school
science team in elementary school. I remember very little science from that
experience. But I remember one wisdom. Good organization and presentation lead
to clarity.

### Why another programming website?

I created [valuedrivendev.com](http://valuedrivendev.com) is to help establish a
technical writing style. It is a narrow and specific goal without a grand
design. I like it that way. I hope this is more achievable than my grand startup
ideas.

This website started as a joke. It really did. Somewhere along the way, close
co-workers and friends of mine provided encouraging feedback. I decided to give
content creation a try. Writing articles for VDD will hopefully improve my
reading, writing and editing skills. I hope you enjoy the content.

### Disclaimer

All content including personal opinions and reflections are mine. I do not
expect all of them to be reasonable. However, I am sure somebody shares similar
thoughts. If you disagree with me, I understand. I would like to present another
perspective.
