    Mentorship at Work
</h1>

June 11, 2015.

<p>
I have a great manager at work. I am grateful for that. All the co-workers
are great too, well, except one. That is for another day.
</p>

<h3>I love being a mentor.</h3>
<p>
You may find this rather odd if you knew me personally. Well, then again, I
am a bit preachy. Look at this website! So, yes, mentorship, I truly find
it so gratifying.
</p>

<h3>Huh, what now?</h3>
<p>
I love growing influence over people. The fact that I can persuade somebody
amuses me. It is even better if everyone repeats back what I say. It starts
with little expressions to a common ideal the team shares. So I try my hand
at influencing others.
</p>
<p>
Of course, that is not all. When I watch people improve their strategies to
debug or solve problems over time, it is like watching plants grow.
</p>
<p>
The key phrase at work now is, <strong>"Is there any value in doing this
    work?"</strong> I did pretty well there!
</p>

<h3>I am aggressive at times.</h3>
<p>
That is not for people I mentor. When I am aggressive, I am really saying,
<strong>"Wake up, you can do better," </strong> because I respect and trust
you enough to "do the right thing."
