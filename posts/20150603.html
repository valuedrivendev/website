If a developer can train two new hires at the same time,
then the best case result is having three developers who can train new hires.
These three developers are probably enough to sustain the training process.
</p>

<h3><tt>3 x 2 = 6 - 4 = 2</tt></h3>
<p>
When there are three trainers, each trainer can train two new hires.
This gives us six newly trained developers. Even if the entire trainer
team quits, we can recover by holding onto two or more developers.
</p>

<h3><tt>T1 &lt;- T2 &lt;- ... &lt;- Tn</tt></h3>
<p>
Perhaps, this is too naive. How about this? We introduce a simple linear
process. Every hire will always train newer employees. If the mentor does not
have an answer to a problem, then we visit the next mentor in the chain. This
leaves the most experience developers to handle the most difficult problems.
</p>
<p>
Experienced developers are expensive and incredibly productive. They should not
be disturbed, and be left to their art where the most value is.
