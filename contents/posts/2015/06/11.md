June 11, 2015.

I have a great manager at work. I am grateful for that. All the co-workers
are great too, well, except one. That is for another day.

### I love being a mentor.

You may find this rather odd if you knew me personally. Well, then again, I
am a bit preachy. Look at this website! So, yes, mentorship, I truly find
it so gratifying.

### Huh, what now?

I love growing influence over people. The fact that I can persuade somebody
amuses me. It is even better if everyone repeats back what I say. It starts
with little expressions to a common ideal the team shares. So I try my hand
at influencing others.

Of course, that is not all. When I watch people improve their strategies to
debug or solve problems over time, it is like watching plants grow.

The key phrase at work now is, <strong>"Is there any value in doing this
work?"</strong> I did pretty well there!

### I am aggressive at times.

That is not for people I mentor. When I am aggressive, I am really saying,
<strong>"Wake up, you can do better," </strong> because I respect and trust
you enough to "do the right thing."
