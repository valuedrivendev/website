June 23, 2015.

We are terrible at code reviews. I think I contribute to the problem. I also
have opinions about them. I **do not** recommend using this style of code review
for training people.

### I think a code review is

an invitation to read a finished work. It is matters of opinion whether code is
"good" or "bad". Sometimes, the competing solutions to a problem are equally
acceptable. By the same token, a style is a part of a presented work to admire.

### If you take a step back,

code reviews become more pleasant. You avoid the temptation to correct the other
person. You check that the presented work is complete, acceptable and correct.

I do not mean "agree to disagree." I ask you to find ways to improve the
presented work. What would you suggest in the **same** approach and style to
improve the code?

### Of course, there are dangers.

Maybe, it is absolutely horrible code. It must be re-written! Well, then maybe,
a second opinion is required. Maybe, it is okay.
