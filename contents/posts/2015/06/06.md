# <a href="#20150606" id="20150606">#</a> Refactoring - Decompose Conditional

June 06, 2015.

I recently bought the book, <i>Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code</i>.
I enjoy reading it a lot.

### I am not a fanatic

when it comes to these topics anymore. I use what produces the most value.
The example below illustrates the idea. Please do not take this literally.
Sometimes, refactoring tiny code has no value.

### An example in Java

Before

    if (min <= x && x <= max) {
        y = x / 2;
    } else {
        y = x * x;
    }

After

    if (inRange(min, max, x)) {
        y = half(x);
    } else {
        y = square(x);
    }

    private boolean inRange(
        int start,
        int end,
        int x) {
        return (start <= x && x <= end);
    }

    private int half(int n) {
        return n / 2;
    }

    private int square(int n) {
        return n * n;
    }

### I use this the most in Clojure projects.

Maybe, that is because I am not so fluent in Clojure yet. The same method
seems to be more valuable in Clojure even for tiny functions. Nested
s-expressions become very confusing quickly.

Before

    (let [y (if (and (<= min x) (<= x max))
              (x / 2)
              (x * x))]
      ...)

After

    (let [y (calculate-y min max x)]
      ...)

    (defn calculate-y [min max x]
      (if (in-range? min max x)
        (half x)
        (square x)))

    (defn in-range? [start end x]
      (and (<= start x) (<= x end)))

    (defn half [x]
      (/ x 2))

    (defn square [x]
      (* x x))
