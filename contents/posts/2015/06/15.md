June 15, 2015.

The website source code is available at
<a href="http://github.com/valuedrivendev/website">GitHub</a>. The bare and
tediously written HTML may surprise you.

I feel great about it. I am focusing on the content, not the appearance of
the website.  The appearance will become important. That is for later.

I believe I am making the right choice. If you agree with me, then I must
thank my sources of free advice.

_Value_ does not always mean money. For example, I hope you
enjoy reading simple sentences on a small screen. This post is, perhaps,
short enough.
